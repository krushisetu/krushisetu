KrushiSetu â€“ A Multilingual Marketplace for Organic Farmers in India
This is a simple, static frontend website prototype that connects small organic farmers with buyers across India. The site supports regional language communication, enabling farmers to list their products and chat with buyers in their own language using an AI-powered chatbot and Indic keyboard simulation. The project is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted using GitHub Pages.
